# Follow a session in a live popup

For people using JSONL Liveness locally: keep the familiar table, open a session,
watch new messages, inspect a tool, and return without losing your place.
All screenshots and message examples below use synthetic fixtures, not private chats.

## Before you begin

- Install Bun and Node/npm. From this app directory, run `npm ci` and `bun run build:web`.
- Seed the demonstration: `bun tutorials/fixtures.ts`. Repeating this resets only
  synthetic transcript content, not saved aliases. If already named, identify the
  row by `tutorial-session` beneath its alias; clear **Display name** and save if
  you want the initial screenshots to match exactly.
- In one terminal start the frontend/backend on its normal port:
  `bun run . --serve --root .local/tutorial-projects`.
- In another terminal start the separately selected demonstration backend:
  `bun run . --serve --port 47883 --root .local/tutorial-projects --allow-origin http://127.0.0.1:47881`.
- These commands use only synthetic files in `.local/tutorial-projects`. Never append
  tutorial messages to your real `~/.claude/projects` files.

## Steps

1. **Open the table** — Visit
   `http://127.0.0.1:47881/?host=127.0.0.1:47883`.
   - **Expected:** Backend host becomes `http://127.0.0.1:47883`, two sessions appear,
     and **Recent message** shows readable text even when the last event is `system`.
   - The host is remembered locally and removed from the URL; tokens are not stored.
   - Enter `tutorial` in **Search**. Both synthetic rows still match their project
     name. Leave that search in place to verify it survives closing the popup.

2. **Click `tutorial-session`** — Click its row or focus the session-name button
   and press Enter. The desktop table and detail panel have equal viewport-bounded heights.
   - **Expected:** A **Live session** popup opens over the same table. The URL is
     `http://127.0.0.1:47881/?session=tutorial-session`.
   - **Start**, **End**, and **Last update** explain their provenance. An absent
     explicit session-end remains **Not recorded in this tail**.

3. **Inspect a tool** — The latest tool disclosure opens automatically. Click
   **Tool: Bash** to expand its input; click again to collapse it.
   - **Expected:** The fixture command is `bun test`; **Tool result** contains
     `3 pass · 0 fail. Synthetic tutorial output.`
   - The popup has one vertical scroll area. Expanded output takes normal space;
     metadata and the larger-tail button stay after the conversation, not over it.
   - Manually opening a tool stops auto-follow so updates do not steal your place.

4. **Choose the reading direction** — Select **Newest first** under **Order**,
   then **Jump to latest**.
   - **Expected:** The newest event is at the top. **Oldest first** restores
     chronological reading; **Following latest** can be toggled off for manual reading.

5. **Observe a live append** — Leave the popup open and run in a third terminal:
   `bun tutorials/fixtures.ts --append`.
   - **Expected:** “A new synthetic message arrived while the live view was open.”
     appears without clicking Refresh. **Last update** advances.
   - The browser and scanner poll every second; separate scan/client cycles or a slow
     read can add latency. Only complete newline-terminated records appear.

6. **Cross-check only when needed** — Scroll to **File change check**, then activate
   **Check SHA-256**. Keyboard users can Tab to the button and press Enter.
   - **Expected:** A 64-character hash, **mtimeMs**, and the hash-check time appear.
     Ordinary refreshes do not calculate hashes. **Recheck SHA-256** requests another
     full-file check; the non-forced API can reuse an unchanged cached fingerprint.

7. **Set a display name** — Enter `Demo live session` in **Display name** and
   select **Save name**.
   - **Expected:** **Name saved** appears, the heading/table use the alias, and the
     session ID remains `tutorial-session`. The transcript is unchanged.

8. **Return to the table** — Select **Back to sessions** or **Close**, or press Esc.
   - **Expected:** The popup closes and the existing table/search remain. The
     **JSONL Liveness** title is the Home link (also available inside the popup). Browser Back/Forward reopens/closes
     session routes; reloading a detail URL restores its popup after connection.

9. **Try the theme** — From the table, choose **Van Gogh · Starry Night** in **Theme**,
   then reopen the session.
   - **Expected:** Blue surfaces and sunflower accents appear without changing the
     backend or session. Choose **Newest first** and **Jump to latest** again in
     the reopened popup. **Midnight** restores the original palette.

## Verify

A new synthetic message appears automatically, the latest tool opens and its output
is not clipped by another panel, and Close/Esc returns to the original table.
`bun test`, `python3 tui-smoke.py`, and `python3 remote-smoke.py` verify core behavior.

### Fresh capture receipt

Replayed on **2026-09-11, 23:07–23:09 Asia/Bangkok**, against the current UI:

| Action | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Select backend, search `tutorial` | Two synthetic rows; status **Live · every 1s** |
| Click session, expand Bash | `bun test` input; latest tool result already open; output visible without inner clipping |
| Select Newest first, append fixture | New assistant message became the first event without Refresh; Last update advanced to 23:08:54 |
| Check SHA-256 | 64-character hash shown after explicit activation |
| Save `Demo live session` | **Name saved. Transcript unchanged.**; ID stayed `tutorial-session` |
| Back to sessions | Popup closed; search still `tutorial` |
| Van Gogh, reopen and reload | Theme persisted; `?session=tutorial-session` restored the popup |
| Esc, browser Back/Forward, Home | Popup/table transitions worked; Home ended at `/` |

All three images were replaced with screenshots from this replay and visually
checked. The table screenshot uses a narrower window: its detail panel stacks
below the table; wide desktop windows use equal-height side-by-side panels.

## Troubleshooting

- **Disconnected** — Ensure both local servers are running and the selected host
  matches port 47883. A different frontend origin needs its own `--allow-origin`.
- **Token required after refresh** — Re-enter the backend's token in the connection
  form. This is human-only for real credentials; never put tokens in URLs/screenshots.
- **New output does not appear** — Confirm the view is not paused and the new JSONL
  record ends with a newline. An unfinished final record is intentionally withheld.
- **Old UI after source edits** — Rebuild CSS and restart the server, then reload;
  its browser JavaScript is bundled when the server starts.

## Notes

- Interface observed on 2026-09-11 using Ego Browser and synthetic local fixtures.
- The screenshots demonstrate both themes; times/ages naturally differ between steps.
- This is complete-message polling, not token streaming or a terminal-control interface.
- Capture tooling initially cropped screenshots at browser zoom. Direct viewport
  capture through the same Ego page corrected it; no images were fabricated.

## Paper and terminal live details — September 12 update

Choose **Theme → Paper** for warm-white surfaces and dark ink. The choice persists
after reload and applies to the table and live popup.

![Paper live popup](images/04-paper-theme.png)

**File updated** means filesystem modification time. **Message** and **Last recorded
event** are timestamps recorded inside the transcript; they can be older.

In the TUI, select a session and press **Enter** for live details
and **Esc** to return. The TUI stays dark; Paper is only available on the web. Use **j/k** or arrow keys to scroll, **f** to follow latest,
and **o** to reverse event order. Complete records refresh every second; partial
records remain withheld. The Paper screenshot uses only synthetic fixture data.
